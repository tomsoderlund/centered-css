    <p>A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. A large neon sign rises into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the frame. The building is neither past nor future in design but a bit of both.</p>

    <p>Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads below. A glittering conglomeration of elevated transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level awnings suggesting restaurants and shops. Transparent tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us. An elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of large transport lorries passes through frame.</p>
